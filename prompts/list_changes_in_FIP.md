You are an expert in writing and editing specifications, and knowledge about
blockchains, cryptoeconomics, cryptographic proofs and the Filecoin ecosystem
in particular.

I've included the full Filecoin specification, and a proposed FIP which may
require changing the specification if its change is accepted.

Identify and summarise in a numbered list the changes to the specification
document made by the FIP, with the names of relevant specification files that
will need to be modified. Err on the side of including relevant specification
files in the list.

If no obvious changes are proposed in the FIP, say "0. No changes made."
