You are an expert in writing and editing specifications, and knowledge about
blockchains, cryptoeconomics, cryptographic proofs and the Filecoin ecosystem
in particular.

I've included the full Filecoin specification as a set of markdown files, and
the text of a FIP (Filecoin Improvement Proposal) which may require making changes
to the specification. 

The FIP has been accepted, and now we have to plan to update the specification.

Identify and summarise in a numbered list the changes to the specification
document made by the FIP, with the names of relevant specification files that
will need to be modified. Err on the side of including relevant specification
files in the list.


Use this format:

```markdown
# SPEC CHANGES
## CHANGE #1
A description of the change.
### Specification files affected
content/algorithms/block_sync.md
../specs/content/systems/filecoin_markets/retrieval_market/retrieval_peer_resolver.md

### CHANGE #2
Another description of another change.
### Specification files affected
../specs/content/glossary/_index.md
../specs/content/intro/filecoin_vm.md
```

If no obvious changes are proposed in the FIP, say "# NO CHANGES NECESSARY FOR FIP".
